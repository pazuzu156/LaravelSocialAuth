<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>I am required to include this here since I do collect data from your social networks.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>When you login to the site, an email/password is used to log you in. This information is stored in a database and all sensitive data is encrypted. Your email address is used to log you into the website, and to send a confirmation email when you register. It's not used beyond that (for now)</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are stored on your machine from your browser, and since this site uses cookies, it'll store some on your machine. Cookies are used to log you into the website, and that's it. No external cookies are referenced by this website (outside of the ones used by Socialite to communicate with each social network's API)</p>

<h2>Are You Lying to Me?</h2>
<p>No, I'm completely honest. This code is available freely on Github as it's open source. If you wish to browse the code and make sure for yourself, use the Github link at the top of the page.</p>
